# Zephyrus Engineering Coding Challenge  

This repository contains my solutions for the coding challenge as part of the application process for the Front-End Developer position at Zephyrus Engineering Limited.  

## Overview  

The challenge consists of four tasks that assess JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation skills. Below is a breakdown of the tasks and my approach to solving them.  

---

## Task 1: Reverse String  

### Problem  
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.  

### Solution  
- The `reverseString` function uses the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods to process the input string.  
- These methods transform the string into an array of characters, reverse the array, and then reassemble it into a reversed string.  

### Example Usage  
Input: `"hello"`  
Output: `"olleh"`  

---

## Task 2: FizzBuzz  

### Problem  
Write a JavaScript function that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print `"Fizz"`, for multiples of five print `"Buzz"`, and for multiples of both print `"FizzBuzz"`.  

### Solution  
- The function iterates through numbers from 1 to 100 using a `for` loop.  
- Conditional statements (`if-else`) check divisibility by 3, 5, or both (15).  

---

## Task 3: Even or Odd  

### Problem  
Write a JavaScript function that accepts an integer and returns whether it is `"Even"` or `"Odd"`.  

### Solution  
- The function uses the modulus operator (`%`) to check divisibility by 2.  
- Returns `"Even"` if the number is divisible by 2, otherwise `"Odd"`.  

### Example Usage  
Input: `3`  
Output: `"Odd"`  

Input: `8`  
Output: `"Even"`

## Task 4: Simple Interactive Feature  

### Problem  
Create a small HTML page with the following features:  
1. A button that changes the text of a heading when clicked.  
2. Styled with basic CSS to ensure a presentable layout.  

### Solution  
- HTML: Includes a heading and a button for interaction.  
- CSS: Styled the page for simplicity and a clean look.  
- JavaScript: Adds an event listener to change the heading text when the button is clicked.  

### Files  
- `simpleInteractiveFeature.html`: Contains the HTML structure.  
- `styles` tag: Styles the page and button.  
- `script` tag: Handles the button click functionality.

## How to Run  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nickson0286/zephyrus.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder.  
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to test the interactive feature (Task 4).  
4. Review the JavaScript files (`revString.js`, `fizzbuzz.js`, `evenOrodd.js`) for solutions to the other tasks.

## Challenges and Learnings  

- Task 4: Balancing functionality and styling while keeping the code modular and reusable.  
- Leveraged JavaScript's built-in methods and DOM manipulation techniques for optimal solutions.
